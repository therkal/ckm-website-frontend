                Corrina and Kenneth met in 2020 through their biggest common passion: photography. They met during the
                Covid-19
                pandemic
                --
                Kenneth lived in the Netherands, while Corrina was situated in the US.
                During that time, they communicated daily being incredibly complex given time zones. In the summer of
                2021
                things started
                looking
                up for the international couple,
                and some of the travel restrictions were lifted. They were finally able to be physically together. They
                overcame
                the distance, and decided to be together permanently.
                They married in February and currently reside in the United States with their three cats: Rou, Stevie,
                and
                Willow.

                Besides photography, Corrina and Kenneth are passionate about wildlife, ecology, zoology, and travel. On
                one
                of
                their most recent trips to North and South Dakota, they met Steve and Kathy Leonardi who inspired them
                to
                take
                their passion for photography and travel to the next level
                and combine them in a business. With Steve's help, the couple started their newest and biggest adventure
                yet!
